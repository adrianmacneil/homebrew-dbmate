# dbmate homebrew formula

### Migrated to homebrew/core

This repository previously housed the `amacneil/dbmate` Homebrew tap. This has since been migrated to [homebrew/core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/dbmate.rb), so this tap is no longer necessary.

If you previously installed dbmate using this tap, please run `brew untap amacneil/dbmate` to remove it.

### Installing dbmate

```sh
brew install dbmate
```
